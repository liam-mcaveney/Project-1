# Project-1 (Slot-Machine)

The goal of this game is to match all 5 slots with the same image.

# Description

This project uses a random number generator to determine a number between 0 - 4, then it uses that number to select an item in an array of images. Then after selecting an image fron the array it then gets sent to the innerHTML of one of the slots. The code goes through this process 5 times then uses the random number that was generated for each image to determine if the slot machine has the same image in all 5 slots.
